# GeneticsHorseRacing

This was my Bachelor Capstone Project

• Created a pipeline using Galaxy, GATK, bash (linux kernel),and R (edgeR limma)
• RNA seq data comprising of horses before and after exercise were used
• Detects differentially expressed genes in horses after exercise
• Detects variants that improve a horse’s performance in racing (sprint or endurance)
• The results provide information on which horse is more likely to perform better based on its variants
• An interactive R markdown html file was created to portray the code and visualize the results.
