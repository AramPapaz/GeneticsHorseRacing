# GeneticsHorseRacing

This was my Bachelor Capstone Project

* We created a pipeline using __Galaxy__, __GATK__, bash (__linux kernel__),and R (__edgeR limma__).

* RNA seq data comprising of horses before and after exercise were used.

* Detects differentially expressed genes in horses after exercise.

* Detects variants that improve a horseâ€™s performance in racing (sprint or endurance).

* The results provide information on which horse is more likely to perform better based on its variants.

* An interactive R markdown html file was created to portray the code and visualize the results.
